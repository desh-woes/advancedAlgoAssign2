# Advanced Algorithms (Assignment 2)
**Objectives:**
- To distinguish Kruskal's approach from Prim's approach in determining the minimum spanning tree given the graph.
- To discover the greedy nature of Prim's algorithm in determining the MST.
- To implement the prim's algorithm given the graph.
- To determine the running time complexity of Prim's algorithm given the algorithms.


### Implementation
The project implementation can be found in the main.py file in the project directory.
